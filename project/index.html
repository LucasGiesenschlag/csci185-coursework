                <h3>Asheville Origin</h3>
                <p>Asheville used to be called Morristown. The name was changed to Asheville to honor North Carolina governor Samuel Ashe, our state's ninth governor who served from 1795-1798.</p>

                <p>Forrest Gump's running journey takes him all over the country, but one memorable scene was in the mountains of North Carolina. The area in question is in Grandfather Mountain near Asheville and has since been renamed to be the "Forrest Gump Curve."</p>
